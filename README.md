# Python-Snake-Game-with-GUI-and-Score-Automation
I developed a Snake Game application using Python and Tkinter with a graphical user interface. The game automatically saves the player score and timestamp into a CSV file as automation. The project demonstrates Python programming, GUI design, and data automation.

Full Description:
This project is a modernized GUI-based Snake Game built with Python and Tkinter. The player controls the snake using arrow keys, eats food to increase the score, and avoids collision. When the game ends, the score and timestamp are automatically saved to a CSV file, demonstrating a simple automation workflow that can later be connected to n8n or other LLM tools for score tracking and analytics.
The game structure follows clean code principles, includes proper folder organization, and is prepared for additional automation or deployable environments.

What Problem Does It Solve / Why:
This project shows how traditional games can be improved with automation logic. Automatically saving player statistics allows future use in dashboards, leaderboard systems, or machine learning performance analytics.

Technologies Used:

Python

Tkinter GUI

CSV automation

(Optional) n8n / LLM integration

Project Status:
✔ Completed and working version deployed
✔ Source code available on GitHub
